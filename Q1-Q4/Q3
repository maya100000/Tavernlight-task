Q3 - Fix or improve the name and the implementation of the below method

function do_sth_with_PlayerParty(playerId, membername)
	player = Player(playerId)
	local party = player:getParty()
		for k,v in pairs(party:getMembers()) do
				if v == Player(membername) then
					party:removeMember(Player(membername))
				end
	end
end

Q3 sol:

-- make function name better
-- make player variable local
-- check if player's party isn't nil.
-- going over party's members using for loop instead of using an iterator (pairs).
-- not creating a player object for each comparison
-- not creating a player object for the delete/removal of the member from the party's members.

-- comparing members' names and not the member objects themselves.
-- this is both more effecient and more correct since we don't assume 
-- the player class's  overrides the __eq method and its implementation is to check player's name.
function removeMemberFromPlayerParty(playerId, membername)
	local player = Player(playerId)
	local party = player:getParty()
	if party then
	         local members = party:getMembers()
			 for i=1, #members do
			      if members[i]:getName() == membername then
						party:removeMember(members[i])
						break;
					end
	        end
	end
end
