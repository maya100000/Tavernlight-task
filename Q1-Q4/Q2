function printSmallGuildNames(memberCount)
-- this method is supposed to print names of all guilds that have less than memberCount max members
	local selectGuildQuery = "SELECT name FROM guilds WHERE max_members < %d;"
	local resultId = db.storeQuery(string.format(selectGuildQuery, memberCount))
	local guildName = result.getString("name")
	print(guildName)
end
